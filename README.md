## INTRODUCTION

Travel Green Carbon Calculator is a web app built with Node.js and React.js that can be used to determine how many kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions you prevent by choosing greener travel options, such as walking or bicycling. Input your origin and destination for travel used and travel avoided, and the Google Maps API will calculate the distances. If your avoided travel mode is a vehicle, enter your vehicle's make and model, and the Carbon Interface API will calculate your prevented CO2 emissions based on the vehicle and distance.
